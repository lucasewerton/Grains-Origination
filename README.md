# Grains-Origination

Python/Pandas Script for Analyzing Brazilian Soybeans and Maize Production (2022/23) 

Objective:

This project aimed to collect data from the National Supply Company (Conab) to showcase in a map the grains production in Brazil.

This script utilizes Python and Pandas libraries to:

Collect data: Acquire data on soybean and maize production in Brazil for the 2022/23 season from a public dataset provided by the National Supply Company (Conab).

Transform data: Clean and prepare the data for analysis, potentially including handling missing values, converting units, and formatting dates.

Merge data: Combine the production data with a separate dataset containing polygon information for each Brazilian state.

Generate map: Create a map of Brazil where each state is colored based on its soybean and maize production quantity.

Extract data: Export the final transformed dataset for further analysis or visualization.
